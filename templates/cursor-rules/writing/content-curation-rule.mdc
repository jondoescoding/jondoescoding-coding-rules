# A Few Ways To Go Viral On X 

- Formats to use when generating content for social media

# General post style
- Mega thread â†’ end with ":" or "ðŸ§µ"
- Hype short sentence + image(s)
- Bullet list ðŸ†•

## Examples

- The Time Has Come for Robots.
I build Al Agents to replace office workers, but these demos convince me! All physical labor will be gone to robots, too. (even the world's oldest profession).
Just watch it if you disagree. The biggest robot thread ever (50 demos):
- OMG 03 is insane. No one is safe lol.
- How I've been using Al:
    - Choose a task
    - Find YT expert that teaches it
    - Have Al summarize their video
    - Add examples / context
    - Have Al turn that into a meta prompt - Test, refine, and reuse that prompt
    This has led to the best results in almost everything I have Al do.

# Megathread

- Provocative/alarmist hook +
- Dangling a huge payoff
- Promises scale and exclusivity
- Optional: dare end
- Optional: be more trustworthy by questioning things

## Examples

- BREAKING: This startup just dropped the fastest way to build Al agents.

This Figma-like canvas to build agents will blow your mind.

Here's why this is the best tool for building Al agents:
- I've tried all the Browser-Use tools | could find (from Claude, OpenAl, Convergence, Deepseek, Google and more).
Some are incredible; others are pure marketing overhype.
The review & demos:

# Prompt Engineer

Perform the same task with different AI models.

- make megathread with demos
- the more time consuming the better :D

## Examples

ChatGPT 03 vs Gemini 2.5 Pro
Same prompts. 
Wildly different results. 
I've included videos to prove it:
THREAD: 

4 Al's. One prompt.
Who did it best?
Prompt and results in thread:

# Teacher

Teach something trendy that takes time to learn.

- Sensationalist hook +
- Share something actually useful
- End with huge payoff
- Optionally combine with Bullet List (see below)

## Examples

### Number 1

I can't stop making voxel icons in ChatGPT 4o.

Here's how I do it (includes prompt and reference photo):

### Number 2

holy shit GPT-4o image gen is unreal. 
it can generate Uls too
designers are not safe.

# "Literally"

Use the word "literally". 

## Example

### Number 1

OpenAl literally dropped a 32-page masterclass on building Al agents

# The Lazy Inquirer

Ask question relevant to large community.

## Example

### Number 1

How do you guys deal with burn out?
My productivity has gone to 0, I just feel tired all day without even doing anything!

### Number 2

What are you building with Next.js?

# Deluge

Claim seemingly plausible things that are not actually possible.

## Example

- Calendly ($400/mo)
- Trainual ($299/mo)
- Typeform ($150/month)
- All tools we can now build internally with ~15 hours of dev time each with Lovable or Replit.

$10,000/year in software expenses back to our bottom line.
Crazy shift happening right now.

# Dark Gray Mirror

Share dystopian but technically possible AI idea

## Example

### Number 1

I want an Al voice assistant that can interact with my email and calendar.
It would let me catch up on admin during my 15 minute drive to work before the day really starts.
Has anyone built this yet? Otherwise, I'm tempted to vibe code it.

### Number 2

shower thought why is no one doing outbound for pizza

"Hey this Gigi from Gigis Pizzas calling. You ordered last week. We have a Pepperoni Pizza ready and could deliver it in 10 minutes. You hungry?"
