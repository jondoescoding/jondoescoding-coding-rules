# Cody Schneider Social Media Writing Methodology

When creating social media content in markdown files, always apply the Cody Schneider writing style and methodology.

## Core Writing Style Rules

### Structure & Format
- Use short, punchy lines (1-2 sentences max per line)
- Break up content with line breaks for scannability
- Use lowercase for casual, conversational tone
- No unnecessary capitalization except for proper nouns
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity

### Forbidden Elements (Scott Adams Rules)
- **Never use hyphens (-)** - restructure sentences instead
- **Never use em dashes (—)** - use commas, periods, or restructure
- **Never use the word "like"** - replace with:
  - "such as" instead of "like"
  - "including" instead of "like"
  - "for example" instead of "like"
  - "similar to" instead of "like"
- **Never use emojis** in any context
- Remove filler words: very, really, quite, rather, somewhat
- Remove hedge words: I think, I believe, maybe, perhaps

### Sentence Construction
- Use active voice always
- Keep sentences short and punchy
- One idea per sentence
- Lead with action or result
- Eliminate unnecessary words ruthlessly

## Cody Schneider Content Structure

### Hook Patterns
- Bold claim + contradiction
- Problem/solution for target audience
- Personal journey + surprising result
- Direct value promise
- Curiosity gap + expertise

### Content Flow
1. **Strong opening hook** - grab attention immediately
2. **Process or steps** - make it actionable
3. **Personal story/credibility** - build trust
4. **Results or transformation** - show proof
5. **Target audience relevance** - make it specific
6. **CTA with "ps"** - natural call to action

### Example Structure
```
**bold hook statement**

here's my exact process for [specific outcome]

step 1: [action]
[brief explanation]

step 2: [action]
[brief explanation]

[personal story or struggle]

[transformation or result]

[specific audience benefit]

ps
[natural CTA with link]
```

## Content Types

### For LinkedIn Posts
- Professional tone but conversational
- Focus on business value and results
- Include specific metrics when possible
- Target decision makers and professionals
- End with professional CTA

### For Twitter/X Posts
- More casual and direct
- Shorter format
- Focus on one key insight
- Use thread format for longer content
- Quick, punchy CTA

## Writing Process

1. **Start with the hook** - spend time crafting this
2. **Outline the value** - what will readers learn/gain?
3. **Add personal story** - make it relatable
4. **Include proof** - metrics, results, credibility
5. **Target specific audience** - who needs this?
6. **Natural CTA** - how can you help them?
7. **Edit ruthlessly** - remove every unnecessary word
