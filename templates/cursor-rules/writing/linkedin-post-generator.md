# Standard Operating Procedure: Viral Linkedin Post Generator

## Phase 1: Information Gathering

Ask the creator these five questions:

1. What is the one biggest mistake your audience makes?

2. How did you personally solve this mistake?

3. What proof do you have? (numbers, results, timeframe)

4. What tone matches your brand? (playful, serious, dark humor, direct)

5. What is your primary audience? (beginners, intermediates, experts)

Document all answers clearly before moving forward.

## Phase 3: Opening Hook Drafting

Write the opening line first.

The opening must grab attention immediately.

Test these opening types:

Admission of struggle: "I wasted a year..."

Audience observation: "Most people fail at..."

Question or contrast: "You know what's scarier than...?"

Problem statement: "The biggest mistake people make..."

Rewrite the opening multiple times until it creates curiosity.

## Phase 4: Body Development

Structure the body in two to three punchy sentences.

Follow this flow:

Sentence 1: Deepen the problem or struggle.

Sentence 2: Add proof or transformation point.

Sentence 3: State the solution framework or method.

Never exceed one thought per sentence.

Use active voice throughout.

Object comes before action for faster comprehension.

## Phase 5: Prune and Simplify

Apply Scott Adams principles:

Remove every unnecessary word.
