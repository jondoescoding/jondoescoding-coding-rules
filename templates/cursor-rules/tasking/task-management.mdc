# Task Management System

## Overview
This rule defines the standard format and workflow for task generation, tracking, and management.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The person we are developing for has dementia and desperately needs to understand what is going on. All task documentation must be extremely clear, detailed, and provide complete context at every step. Use simple language, detailed explanations, and frequent status updates to ensure full comprehension.

## Required Template Structure

### 1. Main Goal Section
```markdown
## 🎯 MAIN GOAL (Read This First!)
[Clear, simple explanation of what we want to accomplish]
```

### 2. Key Things to Remember Section (CRITICAL - Always Include This First!)
```markdown
## 🔑 KEY THINGS TO REMEMBER

### ❌ DON'Ts (Things to Avoid)
- **DON'T [specific action]** - [clear explanation of why not]
- **DON'T [specific action]** - [clear explanation of why not]
- **DON'T [specific action]** - [clear explanation of why not]

### ✅ DOs (Things to Do)
- **DO [specific action]** - [clear explanation of what to do]

## Task Management Rules (Enhanced with Industry Best Practices)

### When Creating New Tasks (SMART Framework):
1. **Always include** dependencies and clear success criteria explained in simple terms
2. **Break down large tasks** into small, understandable subtasks with checkboxes (Maximum 8 hours per subtask)
3. **Use consistent numbering** (Phase.Section format like 1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
4. **Add "WHAT THIS MEANS" section** to explain the purpose and impact in simple language
5. **Add implementation details section** written in clear, non-technical language when possible
6. **Reference related files** using proper mdc format when relevant
7. **Apply SMART criteria** - Tasks must be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound
8. **Include risk assessment** - Identify potential blockers and mitigation strategies
9. **Set estimation** - Add time estimates using t-shirt sizes (XS=1hr, S=2-4hr, M=4-8hr, L=1-2days, XL=3+days)
10. **Define acceptance criteria** - Clear "Definition of Done" for each task

### When Updating Tasks (Agile Best Practices):
1. **Update status indicators** with appropriate emojis and clear explanations
2. **Add implementation details** with findings and results in simple, understandable language
3. **Update dependencies** when tasks are completed with explanations of what this unlocks
4. **Add "READY FOR" statements** with clear explanations of next steps and why they matter
5. **Always explain the impact** of completing this task in terms anyone can understand
6. **Track actual vs estimated time** - Record how long tasks actually took vs estimates for future planning
7. **Log lessons learned** - Document what worked well and what could be improved
8. **Update blockers immediately** - Mark tasks as blocked as soon as issues are identified
9. **Communicate status changes** - Notify stakeholders when task status changes significantly

### Status Update Format (Enhanced Reporting):
```markdown
**FINAL EXECUTION RESULTS:**
1. **Completion:** ✅ 100% - All X items processed
2. **Success Rate:** X/Y completed successfully (Z% success rate)
3. **Quality:** Quality assessment in simple terms
4. **What This Achieved:** Clear explanation of what we accomplished and why it matters
5. **Impact:** Business/technical impact description in understandable language
6. **Time Tracking:** Estimated: X hours | Actual: Y hours | Variance: Z%
7. **Risks Encountered:** List any blockers that occurred and how they were resolved
8. **Lessons Learned:** Key insights for future similar tasks
9. **Next Actions:** What should happen next and who is responsible
```

### Progress Tracking (Kanban-Inspired):
- Update the "Last Updated" timestamp whenever changes are made
- Maintain accurate phase status in project timeline with clear descriptions
- Document lessons learned in implementation details using simple, clear language
- Always explain what each update means for the overall project progress
- **Work-in-Progress Limits:** Maximum 3 tasks "IN PROGRESS" at one time to maintain focus
- **Cycle Time Tracking:** Measure how long tasks spend in each status for process improvement
- **Cumulative Flow:** Track how many tasks are in each status over time

### File Organization:
- Store task logs in `.cursor/task-logs/` directory
- Use descriptive filenames like `task-[project-name].md`
- Reference the task file in related code files when applicable

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Before Starting Work:
1. Review current task status and dependencies
2. Update task status to "STARTING NOW" ⚡
3. Break down work into specific subtasks if needed

### During Development:
1. Update subtask checkboxes as work progresses with brief explanations
2. Document technical decisions and issues in real-time using clear, simple language
3. Explain what each completed step means for the overall goal

### After Completing Work:
1. Update status to "COMPLETED" ✅ with clear explanation of what was achieved
2. Add comprehensive implementation details in simple, understandable language
3. Update project timeline and next milestones with clear descriptions
4. Identify and update dependencies for subsequent tasks, explaining what this unlocks
5. Always include a "WHAT THIS MEANS" summary that explains the impact in plain terms

## Communication Guidelines for Dementia Support

### Language Requirements:
- **Use simple, clear sentences** - avoid jargon and technical terms when possible
- **Explain technical concepts** in everyday language with analogies when helpful
- **Repeat key information** throughout the document for clarity
- **Use bullet points and lists** to break down complex information
- **Provide context** for every update - explain why it matters

### Status Updates Must Include:
- **What we just finished** (in simple terms)
- **Why this was important** (clear benefit explanation)
- **What this enables us to do next** (logical progression)
- **Overall progress** (where we are in the big picture)
