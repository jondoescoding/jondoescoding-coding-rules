# Scott Adams Writing Principles

Based on "The Day You Became a Better Writer" by Scott Adams (Dilbert creator), these principles create clear, persuasive writing that hooks readers and drives action.

## Core Philosophy

Business writing is about **clarity and persuasion**. Simple writing is persuasive. A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences.

## The 6 Essential Rules

### 1. Keep Things Simple
- Simple writing is persuasive
- Don't fight complexity - embrace simplicity
- Focus on one clear message per piece

### 2. Prune Your Sentences
- Remove extra words ruthlessly
- Don't write "He was very happy" when you can write "He was happy"
- Words like "very", "really", "quite" add nothing - cut them
- Eliminate unnecessary modifiers and filler

### 3. Use Active Voice & Proper Structure
- Readers comprehend "the boy hit the ball" quicker than "the ball was hit by the boy"
- Put the person/object before the action
- All brains organize information this way
- Example: "I watched professionals realize..." not "Professionals were watched by me as they realized..."

### 4. Grab Attention with Your First Sentence
- Your opening sentence determines if people keep reading
- Rewrite it multiple times until it creates curiosity
- Make it specific and compelling
- Avoid generic openings

### 5. Write Short Sentences
- Avoid putting multiple thoughts in one sentence
- Readers aren't as smart as you think
- Break complex ideas into digestible pieces
- Each sentence should serve one purpose

### 6. Choose Impactful Words
- For business writing: choose clarity over cleverness
- For engaging content: choose vivid over bland ("swill" vs "drink")
- Remove hedge words ("I think", "maybe", "perhaps")
- Use concrete nouns and strong verbs

## Implementation Checklist

Before publishing any content, verify:

- [ ] **Simplicity**: Can a 12-year-old understand this?
- [ ] **Word Count**: Have I removed every unnecessary word?
- [ ] **Structure**: Person before action in each sentence?
- [ ] **Hook**: Does my first sentence create curiosity?
- [ ] **Length**: Are my sentences short and punchy?
- [ ] **Impact**: Do my word choices drive the message forward?

## Common Words to Eliminate

- very, really, quite, rather, somewhat
- I think, I believe, maybe, perhaps
- actually, basically, literally (unless literally literal)
- in order to (use "to")
- due to the fact that (use "because")

## Forbidden Punctuation and Words

### Never Use:
- Emojis of any kind.
- **Hyphens (-)** in any context - restructure sentences instead
- **Em dashes (—)** - use commas, periods, or restructure
- **The word "like"** - replace with alternatives:
  - "such as" instead of "like"
  - "including" instead of "like" 
  - "for example" instead of "like"
  - "similar to" instead of "like"
  - Or restructure the sentence entirely

### Examples of Fixes:
**Wrong**: "Tools like v0 and n8n—they're game-changers for automation-focused entrepreneurs."

**Right**: "Tools such as v0 and n8n are game changers for automation focused entrepreneurs."

**Wrong**: "I was like, wow, this is amazing—people really get it!"

**Right**: "I thought, wow, this is amazing. People really get it!"

## Before/After Examples

**Before**: "I was really very excited and actually quite blown away by how the participants were genuinely engaged during the workshop."

**After**: "The participants' engagement blew me away."

**Before**: "The tools that we demonstrated have the capability to potentially automate various different business processes."

**After**: "These tools automate business processes."
