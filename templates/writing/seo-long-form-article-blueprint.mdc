# Article Creation Blueprint: The Systematic Method

## Overview
This blueprint provides a systematic approach for creating high-converting, SEO-optimized articles that drive traffic and conversions. Use this framework for any article topic.

## Core Principles

### 1. Always Start with the End Goal
- **Primary Objective:** Drive conversions to your primary offer
- **Secondary Objectives:** Build authority, provide genuine value, rank on Google
- **Success Metric:** Clear conversion tracking per article

### 2. Audience-First Approach
Define your specific avatar before writing:
- Who are they? (job, age, situation)
- What's their biggest pain point?
- What outcome do they desperately want?
- What's stopping them from achieving it?

## Phase 1: Strategic Research (30-45 minutes)

### Keyword Research Protocol

**Research Framework:**
1. Start with 5 keyword angles:
   - [Main topic] + "tutorial"
   - "How to [achieve outcome] with AI"
   - "[Problem] solution for [audience]"
   - "AI [tool/method] for beginners"
   - "[Outcome] without [common obstacle]"

2. Evaluation Criteria:
   - Search volume: 100-50,000 (sweet spot: 1,000-10,000)
   - Competition: LOW to MEDIUM only
   - Intent: Informational or Commercial
   - Relevance: Direct connection to your offer

### Statistical Research Protocol

**Research Requirements:**
- Find 3-5 credible statistics that support your argument
- Focus on: cost savings, time savings, success rates, industry trends
- **ALWAYS provide source links in the article**
- Prioritize data from 2024-2025

**Example Search Patterns:**
- "[Topic] ROI statistics [current year]"
- "[Industry] digital transformation data"
- "[Tool category] vs traditional methods study"
- "Small business [topic] challenges statistics"

## Phase 2: Structured Interview Process

### Interview Framework
**Purpose:** Extract authentic stories and specific details that create connection

**Question Categories:**

1. **Context Discovery**
   - What's the scope? (word count, depth, format)
   - Who exactly is reading this?
   - What action should they take after reading?

2. **Personal Story Mining**
   - What was life like before discovering this solution?
   - What specific moment made you realize things could be different?
   - What surprised you most about the results?
   - What would you tell your past self?

3. **Method Documentation**
   - Walk me through your exact process
   - What tools/resources did you use?
   - What mistakes did you make initially?
   - What would you do differently?

4. **Results & Transformation**
   - What specific results did you achieve?
   - How long did it take?
   - What changed in your business/life?
   - What's possible now that wasn't before?

### Interview Best Practices
- Ask follow-up questions for specificity
- Get exact numbers, not generalizations
- Capture emotional moments
- Document word-for-word quotes
